<h1> An Employee Records System</h1> A program to manage a company’s employee records needs to be flexible and have useful features. The feature set for this program includes the following. <br> ? The ability to add an employee <br>? The ability to fire an employee <br>? The ability to promote an employee <br> ? The ability to view all employees, past and present <br> ? The ability to view all current employees <br> ? The ability to view all former employees<br> The design for this program divides the code into three parts. The Employee class encapsulates the information describing a single employee. The Database class manages all the employees of the company. A separate UserInterface file provides the interactivity of the program. <h2>The Employee Class</h2> The Employee class maintains all the information about an employee. Its methods provide a way to query and change that information. Employees also know how to display themselves on the console. Methods also exist to adjust the employee’s salary and employment status. <h2>The Database Class</h2> The Database class uses an array to store Employee objects. An integer called mNextSlot is used as a marker to keep track of the next unused array slot. This method for storing objects is probably not ideal because the array is of a fixed size. <h2>The User Interface</h2> The final part of the program is a menu-based user interface that makes it easy for users to work with the employee database.
